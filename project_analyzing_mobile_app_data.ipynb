    "In conclusion, our analysis aimed to identify app profiles that have the potential to be profitable on both the App Store and Google Play. We started by cleaning and exploring the data sets, then generated frequency tables to determine the most common genres in each market. We found that the most common genres in the App Store are Games, Entertainment, and Photo & Video, while the most common genres on Google Play are Tools, Entertainment, and Education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our analysis, we recommend developing a gaming app that has elements of entertainment and social networking. This type of app can potentially attract a wide range of users and keep them engaged for longer periods, which can translate to higher revenue. However, it's important to note that our recommendation is based on the current trends and may change in the future.\n",

    "Overall, the success of any app idea depends on several factors, such as marketing, user engagement, and competition. Therefore, it's crucial to thoroughly research and validate any app idea before investing time and resources into its development."
