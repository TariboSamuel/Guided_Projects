    "\n",
    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",

    "**Goal/Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll compare two different types of posts from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. The two types of posts we'll explore begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as \"What is the best online course you've ever taken?\" Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to be Answered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll specifically compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the data set we're working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions."

    "In this analysis, we examined the average number of comments per post for `Ask HN` and `Show HN` posts on the Hacker News website. We found that `Ask HN` posts received more comments on average than Show `HN posts`. We also analyzed the average number of comments per post for `Ask HN` posts by the hour of the day and found that there are certain hours that tend to receive more comments than others. Specifically, the top 5 hours for `Ask Posts` comments were 15:00, 02:00, 20:00, 16:00, and 21:00 in the Eastern Standard Time (EST) time zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I converted the times to the WAT time zone (GMT+1, Nigeria) and found that the top 5 hours for `Ask Posts` comments in this time zone would be 16:00, 03:00, 21:00, 17:00, and 22:00. This information can be useful for individuals or organizations looking to create content on the Hacker News website with the goal of receiving more comments.\n",

    "Overall, this analysis provides insights into the factors that can influence the number of comments received on Hacker News, and may be helpful for content creators, marketers, and other individuals looking to optimize their content strategy."
